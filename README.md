MagikVector
===========
Vector class for 2D, 3D and multi dimensional vector calculations.
 
 
API
====
The API of MagikVector is documented below, some methods are chainable and some 
methods have one or more aliases.

add()
-----
Adds given vector to the current vector, i.e. adds the individual coordinates.

Chainable: yes

clone()
-------
Returns a clone of the current vector, i.e. creates a new Vector Object with the same coordinates as the current vector
  
Chainable: yes     

constructor(...coordinates)
---------------------------
Initialise a new Vector instance with coordinates as arguments, either
supply the individual coordinates or supply an array with number values.

```js
// two dimensional
const vector2D = new MagikVector(12, 15);

// three dimensional
const vector3D = new MagikVector(12, 15, 71);

// multi dimensional
const multiDmensional = new MagikVector(3, 4, 5, 99, 12, 14, 42);

// from Array
const myCoordinates = [4, 6, 28, 5, 33, 12, 8, 22, 785, 38, 56];
const multiDimensional = new MagikVector(...myCoordinates);
```

divide()
--------
Divides the current vector by the supplied scallar or Vector value

Alias: `div()`   
Chainable: yes
	
dotProduct()
------------
Returns the dot Product of the current Vector with the supplied Vector, 
throws an Error if both Vectors do not have the same number of coordinates

Alias: `dot()`   
Chainable: yes
    
getCoordinate(index)
--------------------
Returns the coordinate at the specified index, consider using getX(), getY() 
and getZ() to retrieve the coordinates of a 2D or 3D vector

Alias: `getCoord(index)`   
Chainable: no

    /**
     * 
     *
     * @return {Number} the angle of rotation
     */
getDirection()
--------------
Calculates the direction, i.e. the angle of rotation for this vector 
(only for 2D vectors)

Alias: `getDir()`        
Chainable: no     

getDistanceTo()
---------------
Returns the calculated distance from the current Vector to the supplied one.

Chainable: no        
Aliases: `getDistance()`, `getDist()`   

getMagnitude()
--------------
Returns the magnitude of the vector

Chainable: no

getMagnitudeSquared()
---------------------
Returns the magnitude squared

Chainable: no

getX()
------
Returns the `x` coordinate of this Vector

Chainable: no

getY()
------
Returns the `y` coordinate of this Vector

Chainable: no

getZ()
------
Returns the `z` coordinate of this Vector

Chainable: no

limit()
-------
Limits the magnitude of the Vector to the supplied scalar value

Chainable: yes

multiply()
----------
Multiplies the current Vector by value, you can supply either a scalar value 
or a Vector

Chainable: yes

normalise()
-----------
Normalises the Vector

Alias: `normalize()`   
Chainable: yes

random()
--------
Returns a new Vector with random coordinates, defaults to a 3D vector

Chainable: no

setCoordinate(index, value)
---------------------------
Sets the coordinate at the specified index, consider using setX(), setY() 
and setZ() to set the coordinates of a 2D or 3D vector

Alias: `setCoord(index, value)`   
Chainable: yes

setMagnitude()
--------------
Sets the magnitude of the Vector and returns the changed vector

Chainable: yes

setX()
------
Sets the `x` coordinate of this Vector

Chainable: yes

setY()
------
Sets the `y` coordinate of this Vector

Chainable: yes

getZ()
------
Sets the `z` coordinate of this Vector

Chainable: yes

subtract()
----------
subtracts given vector from the current vector, i.e. subtracts the individual 
coordinates.

Alias: `sub()`      
Chainable: yes
  
toString()  
----------
Returns the string representation of the Vector

Chainable: no

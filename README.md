MagikVector
===========
Vector class for handling two dimensional, three dimensional or n dimensional vectors
 
 
API
====
The API of MagikVector is documented below, some methods are chainable and some 
methods have one or more aliases, both

add
---
Adds given vector to the current vector, i.e. adds the individual coordinates.

clone
-----
Returns a clone of the current vector, i.e. creates a new Vector Object with the same coordinates as the current vector
     

constructor(...coordinates)
---------------------------
Initialise a new Vector instance with coordinates as arguments
```js
const vector2D = new MagikVector(12, 15);
```

divide
------
Divides the current vector by the supplied scallar or Vector value

Alias: `div()`
	
dotProduct
----------
Returns the dot Product of the current Vector with the supplied Vector, 
throws an Error if both Vectors do not have the same number of coordinates

Alias: `dot()`
    
getCoordinate(index)
--------------------
Returns the coordinate at the specified index, consider using getX(), getY() 
and getZ() to retrieve the coordinates of a 2D or 3D vector
     
getMagnitude()
--------------
Returns the magnitude of the vector

getMagnitudeSquared
-------------------

getX
----
Returns the `x` coordinate of this Vector

getY
----
Returns the `y` coordinate of this Vector

getZ
----
Returns the `z` coordinate of this Vector

limit
-----
Limits the magnitude of the Vector to the supplied scalar value

multiply
--------
Multiplies the current Vector by value, you can supply either a scalar value 
or a Vector


normalise
---------
Normalises the Vector

random
------
Returns a new Vector with random coordinates, defaults to a 3D vector

setMagnitude
------------
Sets the magnitude of the Vector and returns the changed vector

subtract
--------
subtracts given vector from the current vector, i.e. subtracts the individual 
coordinates.

Alias: `sub()`
  
toString  
--------
Returns the string representation of the Vector
